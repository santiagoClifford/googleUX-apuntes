# human factors

is really important to keep an eye on human factores:

Describes the range of variables humans bring to their product interactions.

In history, the first time designers started caring about this was because of the war. At first, humans had to adapt to the machine they were controlling. Due to the nature of war, the eventually started needing untrained people to control the machines, and there was ehre they started to design interfaces, that were as easy to understand as possible for humans.

## psychology principles that influence design

1. Von Restorff effect
(Isolation effect)
When multiple, similar objects are present, the one that differs from the rest is most likely to be remembered

thats why call to action buttones tends to differenciate.

2. Serial position effect
When people are given a list of ítems, they are more likely to remember the first few and the last few, while the items in the middle tend to blur

that's why in social media, the most important items tend to be in the start o end of an array. Example, the homebar on instagram, top left is publications, top right my profile.

3. Hick's Law

The more options a user has the longer it takes for them to make a decision

thats why you want to give little options at a time
