# user story

expands on the persona

- prioritize design goals, and decide which is more important
- inspire empathetic design decisions

## format

hero + goal + conflict

As a [type of user], I want to [action], so that [benefit]

As a **type of user** (who), I want to **action** (what) so that **benefit** (why).

### type of user

who are we designing for

ejemplo:

- Anika is a marketing intern who collects coffee orders for their work team.
- Ali is a remote student who spends 3–4 hours a day studying and purchasing products.

### action

what the user hopes happens

- Anika’s pain point is having to submit and wait for orders at the coffee shop. The action they want to achieve is the reverse: being able to submit and monitor orders in advance. 

- Ali’s pain point is having to get up and potentially lose their table. The action they want to achieve is being able to place an order from their seat.

### benefit

why the user wants that to happen

- Anika wants to better manage order accuracy and plan pickup time when ordering for their team. 

- Ali wants to enjoy CoffeeHouse products and continue to work.

"Personas and user stories represent the needs of the users you’re designing for. The more detailed and accurate your personas and user stories are, the better you will be at designing products that meet their needs. "
