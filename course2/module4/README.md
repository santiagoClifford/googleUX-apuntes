# ideate
ideate is al about coming up with lots of ideas. NO JUDGEMENT, explore as many ideas as possible, even knowing that some of them wont work.

How does ideation works in the real world?

brainstorm out loud, document the ideas, quantity>quality, no evaluation allowed, better with a diverse team, question the obvious. Before going to the next step, where you evaluate the ideas, take a break, so your brain is fresh.

When evalluating, think about this adjectives:

- feasible: technically possible to build
- desirable: best at solving the user problem
- viable: financially beneficial for the bussiness
