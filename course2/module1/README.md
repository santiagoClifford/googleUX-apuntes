# portfolio proyect

para esta parte del cuirso comenzaremos con un proyecto, el cual debe surgir a partir de uno de los prompts propuestos, o por un prompt generado por [sharpen](https://www.coursera.org/learn/start-ux-design-process/ungradedWidget/EuPzq/choose-your-portfolio-project-prompt)

prompts que me han llamado la atención:

- Design an app and a responsive website that enable parents to review their children's health records, print the records to meet school or camp requirements, and see when their children’s healthcare visits are due. 

- Design an app and a responsive website that enable consumers to find who represents them in both state and federal government. 

- Design an app and a responsive website that help friend or family groups manage a household budget and save up for a common goal (such as a vacation).

- Design a high-score tracking app for an arcade

- (de mi autoría) design an app for the zoo where you can different challenges and achievements for doing certain things.

## my choice

"Design a high-score tracking app for an arcade"
I chose that prompt because recently i went to an arcade and i had a blast. I think the content on the app and the eventual notifications has great potential. Also I am not aware of any app or web that serves this purpose.
